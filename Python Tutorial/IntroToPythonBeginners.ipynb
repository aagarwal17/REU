    "Some things to notice:\n",
    "1. The variables inside the parentheses of a function are called arguments or args. This may help when you are looking things up in online documentation.\n",
    "2. Every time you \"call\" your function, or use it in your code, you will need to make sure you tell python what values the arguments should take. You can do this by \"passing\" values to the arguments in order, or by explicitly naming the arguments. We showed off both.\n",
    "3. Arguments can be given default values in the function definition. This is what was done with `start_position.`\n",
    "4. For values inside a function to outlive the function call, you must \"return\" them. You can return more than one thing, but make sure you have more than one variable to assign them to. If you have variables that you create inside of your function that you do not return, you will not be able to access them when calling the function. For example, try to print `start_position` inside of your loop, but outside of the function.\n"
