Note: these materials were not presented at the ACRES REU last 
academic year.  They were originally used by Philipp Grete and
Devin Silvia as a Python tutorial for the 2019 Conference for
Undergraduate Women in Physics.  The general idea was that students
could either start with the very basic "Intro to python for beginners"
notebook or, if they were more advanced, jump to the Numpy and 
Matplotlib notebooks.  All will require Python, Numpy, and Matplotlib
installed (so, really, the Anaconda python distribution would be best).
